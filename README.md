# AwfulOwl-main
main repo of AwfulOwl
This project is advised by Prof. Yanyan Jiang

AwfulOwl, means all for all.   
It is a very cool project, which aims to build a distributed computing system on client-side processors.  
(This field is traditionally called Crowd Computing, but lack of attention.) 
We are trying to utilize the idle resources of mobile devices to build a powerful computing platform.   

## phase 1 plan
 ![未命名绘图 drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a7ba5a-b0b3-498c-9008-646fa1d1f6ee)
conduct a demo experiment within Nanjing University.   
- Workload: text-summarization generative model.
- Basic architecture: as the diagram
- Client-side: silent, green software
- Network-side: a p2p + s-c network
- Server-side: fault tolerance, duplicate, scheduler, an abstract distributed model(not sure yet), Security(parallel course proj [here](https://jackcuii.github.io/ProposalTalk.pdf) )
- Simulator
